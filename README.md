# SunMapper
Lightweight and fast object mapper, which creates methods for mapping at the [compile time](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-c-source-generators/).

# Testing ðŸ› 
There are a lot of things that are not implemented yet or some code can give you unexpected result, so use this package at your own risk. 

# Install

* PowerShell:
```
Install-Package SunMapper
```
-- OR --

* Add reference to the project file:

```
<PackageReference Include="SunMapper"/>
```

You can find other ways for installing [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SunMapper/).

# Usage

Add `MapTo` attribute to a model you want to get data from:
```c#
using SunMapper.Common.Attributes;

[MapTo(typeof(UserGetDto))]
public class User {
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string PasswordHash { get; set; }
}

public class UserGetDto {
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```
Bunch stuff will be generated under the hood, that's why you can use extension method `TryMapTo` of `User`:

```c#
var user = new User { Id = 0, Name = "User", PasswordHash = "Hash" };

if (user.TryMapTo(out UserGetDto dto)) {
    // working with dto
}
```
# Limitations 

You can map only **public** properties with **{ get; set }** methods and **the same type**. 

# Milestones ðŸš©
For comfortable using library, this things should be implemented: 
- [ ] Mapping profiles
- [ ] Custom type conversation
- [ ] Upselling architecture
- [ ] Support of popular libraries such as FluentValidation
- [ ] ASP.NET Support
- [ ] Readable generated code
